# muhstik
> irc flooding solution

## Information
muhstik, an enterprise-class fully functional IRC flooding solution for your mission-critical trolling needs, was retroactively created around December 1993 to help perpetuate the incessant wars on #gayteen.

It uses a state-of-the-art event-based system to concurrently connect to proxies and servers.

In fact, testing of an early version of one of muhstik's parent scripts is the reason that freenode now checks for open SOCKS proxies.
